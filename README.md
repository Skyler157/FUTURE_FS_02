# FUTURE_FS_02
Future Interns task 2 was about creating an eCommerce Website.

This e-commerce website is designed to provide users with an intuitive and enjoyable online shopping experience. It features a comprehensive product catalog where customers can browse through a variety of clothing items, from shirts and pants to dresses and outerwear. Each product page includes detailed information such as images, descriptions, available sizes, and pricing. Users can easily add items to their shopping cart, modify quantities, or remove products. The seamless checkout process supports secure payment via integrations with popular payment gateways like Stripe and PayPal. Additionally, the website includes a user authentication system, allowing customers to create accounts, log in, and view their order history. The responsive design ensures that the site is fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, providing a smooth experience across all platforms.
